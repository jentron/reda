Description: Functions to fit gamma frailty model
    with a piecewise constant or B-splines baseline rate function
    for recurrent event data.
    Handy functions to compute and plot nonparametric mean
    cumulative function (MCF) are implemented as well.
    The most functions are S4 methods that produce S4 class objects.
