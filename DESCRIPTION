Description: This package mainly provides functions
    to fit gamma frailty model with a piecewise constant baseline rate function
    (or simply called 'HEART' model) for recurrent event data.
    Some handy functions to compute and plot nonparametric mean
    cumulative function (MCF) are implemented as well.
